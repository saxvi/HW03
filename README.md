# pigeon run!

you are my cat (pigeon) and you are chasing a laser at the top of the screen!

use the left and right buttons to move those directions, and collect the power up treats (small turquoise squares) to increase your speed and get closer to the laser.

meanwhile, you have to dodge obstacles that are in your way. if you get stuck behind or on top of one, it will push/carry you back towards the bottom of the screen. 

if you are pushed all the way off, you lose, but don't worry, you can play again by pressing start!

if you fall too far back, you will change colors, indicating that you are in danger! collect a power up treat to recover. 

if you touch the laser, you win, and your final score (the number of obstacles you pass) will be displayed on the end screen.

notes:
(1) i am only 97% sure the end screen works, i have never caught the laser
(2) obstacles do not seem to be spawning in the far right lane, but if you want to win you have to go between all of them to collect power ups
(3) sometimes the previous pixels do not get erased. i cannot figure out why sorry :)
